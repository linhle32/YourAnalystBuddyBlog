# YourAnalystBuddy
 
This repository contains snippets and Jupyter notebooks of codes for my blog YourAnalystBuddy.com. 

Notebooks and data sets are placed in the same folder and will be maintained as well as updated as I post new contents. Everything (so far) is standalone notebooks and does not need installation except for the basic like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.

Currently, I have had notebooks (and data) for the following topics:

Introduction to Python Programming
- Python variables
- the print() function
- if-else in Python
- Loops in Python

Working with Data Set
- Numpy array
- Numpy operations
- Array concatenation
- Loading data with Pandas
- Pandas dataframe
- Pandas column operations
- Text data in Pandas
- Concatenating dataframes

Exploratory analysis
- Analyze numeric distributions
- Analyze categorical distributions
- Analyze correlations between numeric data
- Analyze correlations with categorical data

Preprocessing data
